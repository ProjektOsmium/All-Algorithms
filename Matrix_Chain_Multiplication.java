The problem is not actually to perform the multiplications, but merely to decide in which order to perform the multiplications.
MCMBU is the function that applies bottom-up approach to solve the above problem.
1. Parameter passed to the function is in the form of array that contains the indices of the matrices to be multiplied.
like array { 40, 60, 20 } indicates two matrices ,first (40 X 60) and second (60 X 20)
2.it returns the optimized solution of the problem that is lowest number of operations to be peformed for above matrices.
